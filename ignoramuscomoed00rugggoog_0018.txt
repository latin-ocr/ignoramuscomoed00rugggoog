His-father, who, as well stom his residence at this place
as fronr‘ other circumstances, is imagined to have follow-
ed the occupatiori os ,a clothier, was descended from an an-
cient and reputablesamily os the nameus Ruggehy, though

since gradually corrupted to Ryggeley, Ryggele, Rugse, and ' ·

lastly to Rnggle, who were originally¹ os Stuffirdfhire, and

Edwurd Ι. viz. A. D. 1298, Ι sind Wzlsium de Ryggele, de

be necessary than tu observe, that the two earliest persrrns 0f
this family, whose names have any where been found, are

, both described with the Latin proposition De prefixed to

‚their surrremeS, in' the records in which their names re-
spedlively occur: the former os the tivo is styled ‘ erliam de
