this his allertion, has produced a long list of instances, at

old evidentes ha've had De prefixed to them, were borrowed
from places, and that this distinet-ion of local names with
De was uniforml observed in records till about the time

‘are unknown to moll men, and all known to no one
‘man¹.’ lt seems therefore certain, according to these
' observatione ol Camden’s, that the sorname Ruggeley was de.
rived from some place; and as one of that name is to bo
found in the county in which their earliest residence is known
to have been, it is submitted to the reader whether the
suppolrtion that the ‘family were originally inhabitants of
Ruggeley is not more than probable ¹³.
