rath of that 'king's reign his name occurs among the gen·
try of Warwicksbire, who made oath for the observante of
the articles concluded *on in the parliament then held‘.

But about the beginning of the sixteenth century, as there ·

is good reason to believe,a younger branch of the famssy,
removing first into some part of Lincolnshire, though to what

place is not certainlylcnown‘l, and very shortly afterwards to¹ ¹

Laprnham, or, as it rs now usually, though corruptly, called,
Laudem, in Suffllk‚ a market-town then of considerable note for

as well as gules‚ signifying the colour red. κ χ ⁰
