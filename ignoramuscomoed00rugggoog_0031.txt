only enabled themselves to imitate and ridicule the habits, gestures,
language, jests, arrd expressrons of the townsmen, but had even bor-
rowed the townsmen's own best cloaths to perform their respestive parts

ing riretted in on both fides by scholare, should have no opportunity
of departing till the play was over, and should therefore be compelled
to sit out the whole performance. The mayor and townsrnen corn·
plained of the insult thus offered them to the lords of the privy council,
but obtained no further redress than a promise from some os them, that
they would shortly corneto Cambridge, and, in order the better· to judge .
of tlte subjest of complaint, and to proportion the punishment to the
nature and degree of the offense, would dire& the comedy to be again
erformed before themselves, and in the presence of the townsmen.
hader, however, than submit to a second representation, the townsmen
thought 'rt prudent to drop all further thoughts of tedress. ·
