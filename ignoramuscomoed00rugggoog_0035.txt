The hopes of the universrty, that'the king would make thern

a visit, had so often been frustrated, that they began now to
sear, that without some exertions on their part to procure it,
such an e'vent would never take place 3 and therefore, to prevent
the consequences osa total disappointmentthey resolved to en-
deavour to obtain that by intreaty, which they, trusting to the
king's well-known preposseffion in favour of literature, and
'Latin literature especially, had before hoped to have receiv-
'ed as a voluntary favour. With this view, they, in the
mouth of August, in the year 1614, applied to their chancellor,
Thomas Howord. ‘earl of Saffolk, then also lord treasurer os
'Englaad and prevailed on him to invite the king to Gam-
lridge, and to entertain him during his stay there: the invi7
· tation was accepted by the king, and apromife obtained from
him, ¹that between Cbrssmus then next and strove-tide he
would gratisy them by a visit ². Ι

very short time before the king's arrival at Cambridge.
