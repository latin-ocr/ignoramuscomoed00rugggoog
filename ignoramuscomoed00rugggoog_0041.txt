⁸ In the uritiffi Museum, among the late Dr. Bircd'c manuscripta,
atrebates, No. 4173, is a colleclion of letters from Mt. chamberlain
to several persons, in the doctor's own hand-writmg, containing, amongll
others, this in the text, which, in Dr, Birch's colledion, is preceded
by one ,dated ad March 1614. To the'latter of these there ils no direc-
tion, but from its contents ΙΙ have no doubt that it was, as wellas that
in the text, written to Sir Dudlqy Carleton. i
bflowes, in his Abridgment cf Stow's Chronicle, edit. 8v0. 1618,
’ gives the following account, which is here adduced in support of the
passage in the text: ‘The 17 os January 1614, it began to sreeze in
< ordi ary manner, and the 23 of January it began to snow, and con-
ld freezing and snowing many days 3 and upon Suciday the twelfth'
‘ of February it began to snow most extremely, and continued until the
⁴ fourteenth of February at noon, and then it abated; and from that
, ‘— time, for many days after, it continued sreezing andsnowing‚ much or
⁸ little, until the fixth or seventh of March, by means whereof much
⁸ cattle perilhed, as calves and lambe, deer and conies, &c by reason
⁴ the earth lay long covered with deep snow, to the 'great hurt of all
= ⁸ manner os cattle, and many were forced to use new devices to fodder ε
‘this snow brou ht extreme danger to all travellers. After this snow ‘
‘ thawed‚ there followed inundatione great and violent, which did great
‘spoils and darnages: p. 344. In his continuatim, at the end of
Stow's Chronicle, edit. 1631, p. 1023, ches has given an account to-
κ the same effedb though not quite so particular as the above, and con-
cludeselp with these words: ‘This suove was very dangerous to ald
