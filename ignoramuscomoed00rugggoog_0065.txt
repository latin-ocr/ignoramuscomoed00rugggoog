Edward Ill. 'vin A: D. ‚136 ,our law proceedlngs were in
French3 but by a statute μᾶζὰ in that year it was enasled,
that sor the suture all pleas should be pleaded, defended, de,
bared, and adjudged in the English, but that they slrotrld be
· entered and enrolled in the Latin language3 and -this pre·-
vailed till· the usurpation under Cromwell, when the language
os our records was altered, and Latin was whollydiscarded‚and
English was employed in its stead. On the restoration os
Charlrs 11. the old practice was resumed, arrd continued to be
observed till the 4th year os George Il. viz. 1730, in which Ι
s year, under the·specious pretence that it was sit that the com-⁴

⁴ 'mon people should be enabled to understand what was alledga

ed sor or' against them in the process and pleadirtgs, and what '
was decided in any cause or suit severally respedrn them, an
, aeros parliament passed, by which it was e ,that the
proceedings at law should be in English3 but it being found
that the several law terms were incapable ofa transsation
into English, another a& os parliament was, two years aster,
viz. oth George ll. passed, enaCting that all technical tenus
should continue to be used in their original languages, viz,
either Latin or French⁸. · - ¹ '· -
It is more than probable that Latin is indebted to the clergy
sor its inooduttion into the profession os the law. Mt.
Barrington, in his« Observatirns on the Statutes, edit.·1775‚
p. 65, after a very attentive peruhl os, and examination into,
· the ancient statutes, remarks, that such statutes as affe& the

' interests os the clergy are generally in Larin3 whence it should

seem that Latin was at least better understood by the clergy
than the Nornran French, in which the other statutes are writ-
ten. Now we sind, from incontestable evidence, that most

r os the great offices os the law have been filled by the clergyuhly¹
