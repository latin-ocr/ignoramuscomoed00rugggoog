But the endeavours of the editor of this second editione
whoever he might be, were not sufficient to correft all
the mistakes, by a very great number, which occurred in
the former 3 and a third edition was therefore publilhed
in the year 1658, which professes, and, as itis believed,
with great truth, to be corrected in six hundr'ed places⁸r

the second representation, as the rest of the comedy, and consequentiy,
