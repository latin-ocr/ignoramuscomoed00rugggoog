¹ Some persons have taken it into their heads that the frontispiece to
this edition, though it has no name to it, was dehgned at least, if not
engraven, by Mr. Hogarth5 but this is scarcely yyobable: the differente
between this and the fonner frontispieces consi s only in introducing

the former ones. The deligo originally had nothing in it of that wit
which distin illies the defigos of Mt. Hogorth3 ²²ld the' print in ques-

‹lesewe the‘name of a new dehgn: ΜΓ. Hogarth would never have sub*
ntittecl to he so servile a copyist.
