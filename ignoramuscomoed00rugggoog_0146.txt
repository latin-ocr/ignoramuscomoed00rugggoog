Martii 8. Anno 1614·r 5.

Inerant Cursore, Eours'o. · ’

Cure. ,ΠΜ quis Musarum Caballum vidit hic? Fon· ¹
y tem Caballinum ut preterii modo, orarunt
Musei, illum ut perquirerem. Hac ego quaefitum missus,
illac ille, quicum curat, Equifh.
EQu· Ecquid de caballo inaudivistin'‚ puer? ¹
Cure. Nihil prorsus, Equiso. Optimum elligitur, tu r
ut praeconium facias.

²ln a copy of the first edition of thie eomedy, now in my poll'ellion,
bert formerly in that of one W. or H.Giffard, sor hie name is so written
init, as to render it very doubtful for which it was meant, the namet
of the original performert in this prologue are inserted in manuscript,
aud arelas follow: Cursor, Mr. Cometen, Musarunr Caballus, viz. Da·
vus Dromo, Mt. halen Equifh, MrsMasom all of whom had also
perte affigued them in the comede itself. See the list of adlors, before
given. This copy has likewise the names of the original edors in the
comedy, putin with apen against their respedlive charadlcrs of the
Dramaris Personae; but without any other designation than that os
the colleget to which they belonged. From this, circumstance, and
also an error of Bargar for Bargraue, the person who played Tereos,
Iam led tn suspect, that the lisl os astoer io the eomedy, and pro· r
behly the names of the performers in thie prologue, was transcribed

⁸ 'from a manuscript at erare Hall, Cambridge, which the well known

Μτ. Baker ol St. Jobn's college, Cambridge, once saw and compared,
andin which he reinarked the above peculiariries. See the list of
actore in the comedy, before given in the author's life, and ΜΓ.
Baler's MS. colreuions in the Bretish Museum, vol. XV, p. 475.
But ae to the rt of Cursor in this prologue, the evidence, that
it war acted by r. Compron, doec not rell solely on the authority

l , ol Mr. Giffard’t copy; for in the 'prologue itself we rneet with the fol·
lowing speech, addrelsed to Cursor: ‘Qudque tu Surdum agas narrem τ’ .

Now ita ars from the lin before inserted, thrlt the part of

Surda in t e¹ comedy was played by Mt. Commeat, and from the y

pnlsagejull cited we may reasonably infer, thatthis prologue was ,
written subsequently to the nominatior of adlors for the play, and with
p ων thet the part es Cursor slrould be performed by Mt. Cortrpton.¹
