'To the charafier of navas Dromo, the hobby5horse, in this pro·
dogne, I find ‘the following allusion in a' little book eutitled‚ Poenis,
elegen, Paradoxes. and Sanun, Laud. 1657, which, though pri ted
without his barne, was written by Dr. Henry King, bilhop of bsi-
chester. Sec Wand's Athene oxonienses, vol: 11. col. 4313 edit. synt.

· The poeni in which the allusion occurs, is entitled, ‘¹ To 'his

The Chrys-chares play, as it is termed above, wasa comedy cny-
titled, Technogamia, er thepMarriage <ff the Artsy it was written by
*Barten Holyday, of Christ-thurci c'nllege, osferd, and was repre-
sented at Woodstock before king James the first. 2⁶ August, ιδῃ. See
an account of the contedy and its author in Wood's Athene oxonienses,

It now only remains to enquire whether any, and what person was
intended to be represented under the tharasier of Davus Dromo, the
hobby·horse‚ rn this prologue3 and forthe urpose of determining

¹this question, an ingenious and learned riend has pointed out -

to me the following passage ‘iu Sir Anthony Weldon’sCsurt and Cha-
ναῖεν os king Jamess ‘Then [i.' e. about the time that Villiers,

afterwards duke of duringiam, became his favourite] ‘began the .

1 pastimes and fooleries, in which Sir Edw. Sorech, SirGeorge (lesing,

In the second prologue·tothis comedy‚ as well as inyhe present, the

' character of Davus Dromo is also introduced, and inthat prolo‘g‘u‘e

are several references to fabis and passages either mentioned or alluded
toiu this first. From hence it most evidently appears, that the cha·

rafier of Daws Dromo in both, must have beenintended for the same ⁰

person, and after reading the above passage, and observing tha‘t
these words, 1 Ausus tu es etiarn tiitare curn regis stulto,’ addrelfed to
DavusDrotno, occur in the second prologue, no doubt ean remain
that by the charaCter of Davus Dromo in both, the abovementioncll

ermenone, was tlte person intended. And infurthcr coufirmauon of
