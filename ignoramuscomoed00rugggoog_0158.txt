*Ualen el Plaudite-e] The following anecdote respeeh'ng the pas-
sage in the text, has been preserved by tradition. When this pro·
logne was performed before king James, on the second representa· ·

formance of the eomedy had adually been received, he grew very
angrp, and peremptorily commanded the delore to proceed. l'aying he
would not be disappointed of th'e entertainment it would afford him.
