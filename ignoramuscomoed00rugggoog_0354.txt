· ⁸ 'unhdplpyq This word formerly not only bore the confined'sense

, which we now allign to it, as aPplying to any disastrous or unfortunate

accident, but also signified a waggilh, mischievous, or unlucky properi.
sity, in the same manner as we now use the word unlucky. We at this
day say of any untoward event, that it was unlucky3 and we also term ¹
a mischievous or comical niele, played bya boy upon any person, an
unlucky trith, and the boy who perfomis rt an un ucky lad or rogue.
In support of the for'mer part of this affertion the following authorities
may be produced. , Howell in his Letters‚ edit. 4to. 1645, feel. 1. p. ,
38, in a letter to his brother Dr. Howell, speaking of the murder of
the Marquis of Anae, who had been the favourite minister of Mary de ,
Medicis during' the minority of Louis XIII. of france, says, that after
his death ‘Ancre's body was buried that night in a church hard by
⁶ the court3 but the⁴ next momingssthe laquays and peges (who are
⁴ more unhappy here than the apprentices in London) broke up bie
‘ grave, tore his coffin to pieees, ripped the winding lheet, and tied hie

‘ body to an ‘ass's tail, and so dragged him up and down the guttere of ’ ’ .

‘Paris’ dcc.

Iu uie same sense the English proverb, ‘ An unhappy lud may make
⁴ a good man,' or, as it ie sometimes given, ‘An unhappy bo may
⁸ malte a good man,' is certainly to be understood3 though Mt. [lay in
hie collemon, p. 116 and 1⁶5, conliders it as synonymous with ‘A '
„ ⁴ ragged colt may maltea good horse ς’ and consequently says of the
⁸ former as well as of the latter, that· it is ‘ used sometimes to hgnify that

, ⁴ children, which seem less handso'me when· young, do afterwards· grow

¹, into lhape and comeliness; ason the contrary we say, “ Fair tn the
“ cmdle and foul in the saddle;’' and the Scots, “ A kindly aver will
“ never make a good horse.'' Now it is imagined that no instance can
be produced in which unhappy was ever used, unconneued with any
other word to explain it (as itis in this proverb) for the purpose of ex-
presftng ugliness ol deformity3 ond Mr. Ray is therefore undoubtedly “
mistaten in his interpretation of it. '
