See Camden's Remains, tit. Proverbs. The proverb, ‘As bold as blind
¹ bayard,‘ is at least, as old as the time ol Chaucer5 sorio the Chanoneo
Yeman's Tale is the following pass'ag22

‘ Ye ben as bold as is Bayard the blind,
‘ That blondereth forth, and peril casleth rron;
‘ He is as bold to renue aguino a lion, ·*

Junius, in his Etymvlogicum Anglicanum, says, ‘ Bayard proprie est

The very learned editor os the above-cited edition of e Canterbury
Tales, informans, in his Glossary‚ that Bayard is a Frencb proper
name, and originally fignified a bay horse, though it since has
been used for aborse in general. And lastly, Cotgrave in his French
Didionary, edit. Howell, arr. quar, notices that a bay'horse is
termed a bayard. y Δ

Burton in his Anatomy osMelancboly, p. 377, censores the temerity of
good wives, as he terma them, for administering medicines‚ particularly
Hellebore, in too large quantities. He says that Dr. ‘Turner in his
Herbal notices that they ordinarily gave it in powder to ii d. weights
which Turner is not much against; ‘ but,‘ adds burton, ‘ they do com.
