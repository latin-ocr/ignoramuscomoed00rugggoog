effest of which isto excite, in the highest degree, compaffion for the suf·
seringe of Ro abella, and indignation and resentment against Theodorus,

be hastily asfecl ou it; 'it will be necessary here minutely to investigate
this part oi the character of Theodorus. But first itmust be observed that
in the scene now before us we see a man os confesfedly ood inclinatione

and in so doing to commit a crime, on which rn lna cooler mospents
he reflefls with the utmoslabhorrence and detestation. The mr dof

a man cannot in any instance be imagined, while hie reason maintaina her

proper ascendant, fo corrupt as wilfully‚ calmly, and deliberately, to

te greatest crimes, and at others deceive them into an opinion that
the ast they are about to commit is not a' crime but an asi of justice.
