thorities, ventuted to restore. The passage in the text, however, con.
⁴ tains an allusion to a poem, written, as it should seem, between the time
of the first and second representatione of this comed , in the character
¹ of John a Stile, student in the commonlaw, an addressed to the .
’ comedians of Cambridge in consequence of this play. It has beenlately
’ recovered from a manuscript colledtiou os miscellaneous poems iu the
Maestum, Sloane MSS. No. 1775, and is as follows:

ι ‘ 'fo the⁴ comediam of 'Cambridge who in 3 adis· before the king
ζ’ dlllffilbblllkilesllllkmlrltnhlnllllll?
⁶llbbskl‘rlllllbk{⁹:st Μ suu 'udgm‘mmd

‘ Faith, gentlemen, 1 do not blame your wit,
:lrzrrrnfilnrrn anri,
, ’ ⁸ Not unto malice, but to ignorance3
‘- th know the world by map, and never dare,
‘ If beyond Barkeway ride past Ware,
’ ’ ‘ But madly spurgall home unto your schobls,
- ‘ And there become exceeding learned fools.’

Very unfortunately the'srxth line of the above poem, whichis also thatre· -
ferred to by the text, rs defedlive in the manuscript, and a space ir left ψ
sor the insertion of a word to fill up the line 3 perhaps we ssrould read, ,

‘ If beyond Barkeway gone, to ride past Ware.·‚

By the words ‘ut eleganter quidam legalispoeta,' it is very evident
that the author of this poem was meant, who having assumed the chass
meter of John a stile, student in the common law, might properly be
referred to as being ‘ quidam legalis poeta? y

d Sere'niffime Domine-] We have before remarked that the king waa
present both times when this comedy war acted at Cambridge.
